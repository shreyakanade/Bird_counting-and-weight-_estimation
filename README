# Poultry Monitoring Prototype

## Setup

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run server: `python main.py`

## Counting & Weight Method

- **Counting:** YOLOv8 detects birds; ByteTrack assigns persistent IDs and handles occlusions via Kalman filtering.
- **Weight:** Calculated as 'Projected Dorsal Area' (Pixel Area). Grams require a reference object calibration (e.g., $Weight = Area * k$).

## API Usage

`POST /analyze_video` with a video file.
